Databound control support made general (Have endcurrentedit method.  test it is being used by all property sets..)

add packaging target to nant for a release

Check invokerequired before touching control properties or invoking methods.

documentation in cvs.. add target to update website.

fxcop on build

code coverage back in

Debugging information log to control finder.

Support all native dialogs.. MessageBox, FileOpen, FileSave, etc.. (message box done)

Recorder should support modal dialogs as well as the testers do.

Recorder should have option for mouse recording.

Recorder should have option for keys recording.

Support Dynamically Added Menus.

Complete testing of recorder application internals.

Support all built in control types.

Properties object subdivided by "Category" (Appearance, etc... as in tool box) (Not just exposing the inner object, although this does give complete flexibility, we are striving for ease of use.)

Need to add more automated tests for the recorder application.  Use NUnitForms once we have enough controls supported.

Separate the logic from the recorder app's code behind to illustrate mock objects and test the GUI explicitly.

Not just abstract classes, but any classes with subclasses.  (search for IsAbstract)

Generate tests with mocks (Constructor based dependency injection)

Determine whether it is appropriate to set IsUserInteractive true when called from service like cruise control.

Find out what went wrong with Mouse and keyboard tests. Fix with more robust automation apis in .net 3 ? (All this win32 api cruft is not fun)
